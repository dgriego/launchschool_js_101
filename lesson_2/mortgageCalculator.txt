1. monthly interest rate -
2. loan duration in months

FORMULA:
let m = p * (j / (1 - Math.pow((1 + j), (-n))));

m = monthly payment
p = loan amount
j = monthly interest rate
n = loan duration in months

SEMI-PSEUDO

1. START and WELCOME

2. RETRIEVE and VALIDATE
 1. - loan amount (SET loanAmount)
  - parseFloat at 2 decimal places
  - validations:
    - must be a valid float

 2. - APR (interest rate as a whole number) (SET apr)
  - convert to monthly rate (r / 12) (SET monthlyInterestRate)
  - parseFloat at 2 decimals
  - validations:
    - must be a valid float
  SET apr = GET apr
    - validFloat
    - check for errors

 3. - loan duration
  - convert years to months (y * 12)
  - add months to ^
  - validations
    - years must be valid whole number
    - months must be valid whole number
  SET loanDurationInMonths = 0
  GET loan duration in years
   - parse to Int * 12 and increment loanDurationInMonths
   - loanDurationInMonths = parse Int * 12
  GET loan duration in months
   - loanDurationInMonths = ^
2.a On validation error
  - display valid values and prompt for input again

3. CALCULATE
  Run formula to retrieve
  1. monthly payment - let m = p * (j / (1 - Math.pow((1 + j), (-n))));
  2. total payment including interest
    - monthly payment * months
  3. total interest
    - total payment including interest - loan amount

4. DISPLAY
  1. format dollar amount
  2. format dollar amount
  3. format dollar amount
